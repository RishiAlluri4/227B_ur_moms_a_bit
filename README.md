## Branch Naming Convention  
  
To keep things organized, we'll be following a specific branch naming convention for this project:  
  
- `feature/<feature-name>/<author-name>`: Use this for new features.  
- `bugfix/<bug-name>/<author-name>`: Use this for bug fixes.
- `doc/<document-name>/<author-name>`: Use this for updates to documentation.  
  
Replace `<feature-name>`, `<bug-name>`, `<hotfix-name>`, and `<document-name>` with a brief description of the feature, bug, hotfix, or document you're working on. Replace `<author-name>` with the contributors name. 
  
Please use hyphens to separate words in the branch name, and keep everything lowercase.  
  
For example, if you're working on a feature to add login functionality, your branch might be named `feature/add-login`.
